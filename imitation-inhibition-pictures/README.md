# imitation-inhibition-pictures

These are the pictures used for the online imitation-inhibition task. To avoid any modification (renaming etc.), this repository is also archived. The pictures can also be found on the [OSF of the online task](https://osf.io/q7fju/). 

The pictures are, for example, the original pictures from the first imitation-inhibition task by Brass et al. (2000). But also mirrored and rotated versions of these pictures. The picture CFD-WM-213-076-N is an example picture of a face from the Chicago Face Database (Ma et al., 2015)
