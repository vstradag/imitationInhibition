This repository contains the jsPsych version 6.1.0. This repository is used only to enable the online-imitation-inhibition task on Qualtrics (https://www.qualtrics.com/). For this reason it is not directly modifiable and thus archived to make the task work on Qualtrics without problems. We do not own any rights to jsPsych.

## Excerpts from the readme of the jsPsych repository

[...]

jsPsych is a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser. 

Experiments in jsPsych are created using [plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/overview/plugins/). Each plugin defines different kinds of events, like showing an image on the screen, and collects different kinds of data, like recording which key was pressed at which time. By assembling different plugins together into [a timeline](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/overview/timeline/), it is possible to create a wide range of online experiments.
