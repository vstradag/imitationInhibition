# custom_plugins
These plugins are based on various JsPsych plugins from JsPsych version 6.1.0. They are used to enable the online-imitation-inhibition task on Qualtrics (https://www.qualtrics.com/). For this reason they are not directly modifiable to make the task work on Qualtrics without problems. We do not own any rights to jsPsych. If you want to contribute to jsPsych please refer to the [jsPsych Repository](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych).
